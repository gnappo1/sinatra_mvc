# Lab Analysis Sinatra

In this little Sinatra MVC app we worked on:

- Building our database and tables respecting the associations needed
- Wiring up the associations in the models using AR macros (has_many, belongs_to, has_many through)
- Using the MVC design pattern to separate the concerns inside the app folder
- Connecting multiple controllers with Inheritance and loading them in the config.ru
- Practicing with CRUD actions in the controller
- Building view files and rendering them from the controller
- Pre-loading associations to reduce N+1 queries (just introduced)
- Building user authentication
- Adding some style with Bootstrap
